<p>When i lived in Los Angels one of my favorite place to go was some park in Beverly Hills, CA. There were severl reasons reason i loved going to this park. The first reason is the park had a huge inground swimming pool, if it was a hot day i could go swimming with my friends. The second reason is the park had a huge playgorund with all kinds of slides and swings. If my cousins or my friends was there we would all go on the swings and slides. The third reason is the park had three full court of basketball hoops. There was always be a lot of people playing on the courts, i would get my five together to play full court pick up games. The fourth reason is there was a huge playing field where people played football or soccer. If there were guys playing flag football, i would also play. The fifth reason is there was always cute girls there. Fridays was the best day to see all the cute girls coming home from school. The cute girls would always watch the guys play basketball because that's there thing. I would always try to impress the cute girls while playing basketball.</p>
