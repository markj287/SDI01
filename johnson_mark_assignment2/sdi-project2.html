<p>when i was younger i use to drive the Philadelphia every weekend to visit my ex girlfiend. There are two ways to get there. I wouldn't take the Ben Franklin Bridge if there was an accident, too much traffic or the time of day it was. I would take the Schuykill ExpressWay instead. If there was too much traffic or an accident on the Schuykill ExpressWay i would in turn take the Ben Franklin Bridge. If there was an accident or a lot of traffic on the Schuykill ExpressWay and the Ben Franklin Bridge, i would defer to take the Schuykill ExpressWay.</p>
