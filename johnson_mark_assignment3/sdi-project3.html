<p>When i was a young boy my favorite place to go was to my grandmothers house. There are severl reasons why my grandmothers house was my favorite place in the world. The first reason is she had a swimming pool, if it was a hot day i could go there and chill out in the pool for a while. The second reason is had a huge backyard with a playground in it, if my brothers and cousins was there we would all go on the swings and slides. The third reason is she had a huge basement with a cool videogame system, if my brothers and cousins was there we would have mortal kombat battles for hours. The fourth reason is she cooked some delicious food, if she calls and says come get some food i would run over there. The fifth reason is she is the best grandmother in the world, if my mom was working overnight i would go to her house to sleep with her. I would also go there on the weekends when i was off from school.</p>
